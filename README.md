# BrowseNGrab
BrowseNGrab is a bash script that consolidates bookmarks from all browsers on the system into one place, which can be exported to other browsers. The script is currently in development and further plans include creating a model to categorize the bookmarks into different folders.

### To use BrowseNGrab, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/bookmark-consolidator.git
Change directory into the repository: cd bookmark-consolidator
Make the script executable: chmod +x bookmark-consolidator.sh

## Usage
To use Bookmark Consolidator, follow these steps:

- Open your terminal and navigate to the repository directory.
- Run the script: ./browsengrab.sh
- The script will scan all browsers on your system and consolidate the bookmarks into a html file.

## Exporting Bookmarks
To export the consolidated bookmarks to another browser, follow these steps:

- Open your target browser and navigate to its bookmarks manager.
- Import the html file generated by BrowseNGrab.
- The bookmarks will now be available in your target browser.

## Bookmark Categorization
Bookmark Consolidator currently does not have bookmark categorization. However, we plan to create a model that can categorize bookmarks into different folders. We will update this README file with instructions on how to use this feature once it is available.
